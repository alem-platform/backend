## Learning Objectives

- Concurrency Patterns
- Real-time Data Processing
- Data Caching (Redis)

## Abstract

In this project, you will build a **Real-Time Market Data Processing System**. This system will be able to process a large volume of incoming data concurrently and efficiently.

Financial markets, especially cryptocurrency exchanges, generate vast amounts of data. Traders rely on real-time data to make decisions. This project will simulate the backend of a system that processes real-time cryptocurrency price updates from multiple sources. However, to ensure the system remains functional without external dependencies, the project will also support a test mode where prices are generated locally.

This project will give you hands-on experience in **real-time data ingestion, processing, caching, and storage** while ensuring data consistency and performance using **Go's concurrency primitives**.
