## Abstract

In this project, you will rewrite the existing [hot-coffee](https://github.com/alem-platform/foundation/tree/main/hot-coffee) project to work with a PostgreSQL database. The main task is to modify the current handlers in hot-coffee so that they execute SQL queries instead of working with JSON.

In addition to refactoring the existing handlers, you will add several new ones related to aggregation and reporting. Throughout this project, you will learn to perform basic and advanced SQL operations and explore aggregation tools provided by PostgreSQL.
